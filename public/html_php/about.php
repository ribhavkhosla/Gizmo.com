        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>We are an Ontario-based corporation that sells electrical devices to customers across the province. If you don't want whatever you have, place an ad on our website to attract the attention of those who might be interested in buying it. Our website allows users to browse our pages and choose what they want to do. We built a company on the simple premise that "one man's garbage is another man's treasure."</p>

        <h1>How We Started</h1>
        <p>Because it was a problem that affected everyone, this idea was not difficult to come up with. It's difficult to discover someone who is interested in what you're offering if you don't have access to the internet or a reliable connection. We came up with the idea of putting everything on one website where people could interact and inquire about each other's products that might be on sale.</p>
