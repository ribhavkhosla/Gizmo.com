*Screenshot of welcome.html*

This is the homepage of the website. On this page, there is a top bar that has Tabs to go to different pages of the website. On the left side, we have our Logo and an animation depicting different categories we deal in. On the right side, we have the SignIn/ SignUp section. Clicking on the “Sign Up” Button we will see a popup with a sign-up form.

**Color Palette**

We wanted to keep our number of colors used to a minimum to give a concise and neat look for our website so we chose three colors: blue, white, and black as the main theme of our website. Green was used as a submit button wherever there was a form required.


||<p>Color: #2179b5</p><p>Usage: Nav bar item hovering, Logo, Heading Highlights</p><p>Background on texts, buttons background</p>|
| :- | :- |
||<p>Color: #ffffff</p><p>Usage: Background for all our web pages, text color, background on texts, buttons background </p>|
||<p>Color:#000000</p><p>Usage: Used on the majority of the texts, </p><p>Borders.</p>|
||<p>Color: #008000</p><p>Usage: Only used for a submit button on a </p><p>forms page</p>|

**Fonts and Type Scale**

Almost all the web pages are written using “font-family: 'Times New Roman, Times, serif;”. Except for in the welcome.html the looping message “We deal in Categories”, which uses “font-family: Courier”.

**Icons/Images**

Some Images that are used are supposed to be placeholders until the website is fully functional. Rest will remain permanent and become part of the final resulting website.

On the “welcome.html page” in the Sign In / Sign Up section, the icons on the bottom of the section are used from an external library which is imported from:

*"<https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.4.0/dist/ionicons.js>".*

**Buttons and Form Elements**

**	Most of the buttons that are used are non-functional for the time being with some exceptions. The buttons are:

- **Login** on *welcome.html*
- **Sign Up** on *welcome.html*
- **Post an Ad** on *choose.html*
- **Buy Stuff** on *choose.html*
- **Previous** on *postad.html*
- **Post Ad** on *postad.html*
- **View Ad** on *buyer.html*
- **Clear** on *contact.html*
- **Submit** on *contact.html*

We used three forms on our website. One for the user to create their account on the website, another to create an ad and post it, lastly a form to contact us (owners of the service) for any issues for the website.

**UI Components**

Our Four most prominent UI Components include the typing animation on our welcome page that types out all the products that we deal in from the source: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/typed.js@2.0.12". Another component is a pop-up form that we used for the user to create their account when they click on the sign up button in the welcome page. Hover component that changes the nav elements’ color scheme when the mouse hovers over them. “Choose your category” drop down menthe u on buyer’s page that shows you all available categories of electronics a user can choose from that will filter the products belonging to the same category.
